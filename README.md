# JavaScript-Notes
I am writing some javascript notes and explanation of javascript in this repository.


## JavaScript Introduction: 

ðŸš€ ###JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. [developer.mozilla.org]

ðŸš€ **Brendan Eich** created JavaScript in `September 1995 within 10 days` and became an ECMA standard in `June 1997`

ðŸš€ **ECMAScript** is the official name of JavaScript. ECMAScript stands for 'European Computer Monufacturers Association Script'. ECMAScript published in the first edition of the `ECMA-262` standard in June 1997.

**JavaScript History:**
In 1995, JavaScript was created by a Netscape developer named Brendan Eich. First, its name was Mocha. And then, its name was changed to LiveScript.

Netscape decided to change LiveScript to JavaScript to leverage Javaâ€™s fame, which was popular. The decision was made just before Netscape released its web browser product Netscape Navigator 2.

ðŸš€ Morder JavaScript is ES6(2015) [the 2nd revision]
ðŸš€ Since 2016, new versions are named by year(ECMAScript 2016/2017/2018). So, current version of ECMAScript is ES2022
